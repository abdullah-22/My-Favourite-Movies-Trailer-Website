# Project # 01: Website - My Favourite Movies' Trailers
## by Abdullah A. Salman

This project is built as an effort for the first project of ***[Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/)*** .

I have built this project as python scripts, css styles, some jquery code and HTML templates which collectively generates an HTML webpage. The contents of the webpage include listing of my favourite movies, main information about them and it plays their trailer too.    \~(˘▾˘~)

In order to run this project on your PC, you need to have python 3.x or later installed. (You can get it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) 
Your web browser should also support HTML5, CSS3 and Jquery. 
>Well, most of the browsers already do that ;)

What to do now ?
-

 - Once you are sure to have the above mentioned requirements fulfilled, feel free to download the project as .zip file or clone it to your PC.
 - After syncing it to your PC or downloading and unzipping it, you can see the following directories and files hierarchy:
 ```
My-Favourite-Movies-Trailer-Website
├── _pycache_/
|   └── *.py  //some python files, ignore these 
| css/
│   └── main.css
├── imgages/
│   └── background_main.jpg
├── js/
│   └── main.js
├── templates/
│   └── body.html
│   └── header.html
│   └── movie_tile.html

├── .gitignore
├── entertainment_center.py
├── fresh_tomatoes.html
├── fresh_tomatoes.py
├── media.py
├── movies.json
└── README.md
```  

- You can run the main program by double click on the *"entertainment_center.py* file, or by running it from python shell or command prompt by following command:
```
python entertainment_center.py
```
- andddd ... voila !!!

Extras
---------
Well, I have, potentially, tried to fulfill all the requirements of the project as discussed [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2/view) and [here](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/movie-trailer-website-checklist-read-this-before-you-submit-your-project/39852). Since, it was super fun doing this project, I put little efforts to make my project work and look better.
For this purpose I:

 - avoided hard-coding the data within the main code and used json instead
		 *- this can be useful in future, if the data is fetched through some API*
 - separated html placeholders, css styles and jqeury code in different files and folders, for better understanding and change management
 - improved the look and feel of the resulting page by changing background, adding shadow effects, displayed more information of movies etc.
>still open for suggestions and feedback ... let's make it better together :)
